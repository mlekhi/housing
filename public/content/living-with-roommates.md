# Roommate Discussions: Moving in Together? Discuss this first!

## Typical Weekly Schedule

When moving in with roommates, you should discuss daily routines to hopefully avoid conflicts and ensure efficient use of shared spaces. Understanding each other’s schedules including class times, sleep patterns, and general availability can help coordinate access to common areas such as the kitchen and bathroom. This proactive approach prevents congestion and ensures that all roommates can comfortably use shared resources without inconvenience.

Additionally, discussing sleeping habits early on is key to maintaining a peaceful living environment. Some may require complete silence to fall asleep, while others may be comfortable with ambient noise. By setting expectations regarding quiet hours and sleep schedules, roommates can foster a respectful and accommodating atmosphere.

## Partying / Substance Use
Establishing clear expectations regarding social gatherings and substance use is important for maintaining a comfortable shared living space. Discuss whether hosting guests or parties in the residence is acceptable and, if so, how frequently. Openly communicating personal preferences, whether for a quiet and private environment or a more social atmosphere, can help avoid misunderstandings and create mutual agreement on household dynamics.

Similarly, it is important to address boundaries around alcohol and substance use. If any roommates prefer a smoke-free or alcohol-free environment, these expectations should be clearly communicated at the outset.

## Guest Policy
A well-defined guest policy makes sure that all roommates feel comfortable in their shared space. Key things to discuss include how often guests are permitted and whether overnight stays are acceptable. It is also important to consider the impact of guests on shared resources such as utilities and household expenses.

Additionally, maintaining balance in the living arrangement is crucial. Roommates should respect each other’s privacy and avoid situations where frequent visitors create an unintentional added resident. 

## Pets
Before introducing a pet into a shared living space, roommates should agree on their comfort levels with animals. Some may have allergies or personal preferences that affect their ability to live with pets.

If a pet is permitted, you should establish responsibilities for its care. This includes feeding, cleaning, and covering associated expenses such as food and veterinary bills. 

## Chore Division
Maintaining a clean and organized living space is a shared responsibility. To avoid imbalance and likely tension after, roommates should establish a fair system for dividing household chores. Responsibilities can be assigned based on personal preferences, and we’ve found that rotating schedules also work.
In addition to task allocation, roommates should agree on the frequency of cleaning. Whether chores are completed on an as-needed basis or according to a designated schedule makes a massive difference. Make sure to also objectively define what, “as-needed,” means.

## Cost Splitting
Roommates should agree on how rent, utilities, and other costs will be divided. If certain rooms have different sizes or amenities, it may be appropriate to adjust rent contributions accordingly. Similarly, if one roommate frequently has guests, their share of utilities may need to be higher.

Shared household expenses such as internet, cleaning supplies, and communal kitchen items should also be discussed. Roommates can decide whether to split costs evenly or take turns purchasing necessities. Establishing a clear financial agreement from the outset helps prevent financial issues, the root of many disputes.

## Interests / Hobbies
A successful roommate relationship extends beyond logistics, you should all also be enjoying your time in the house! Take time to understand each other’s interests and hobbies. Engaging in shared activities, whether watching movies, cooking meals together, or exploring the local area, can contribute to a better dynamic. Even small efforts like jokes can make a massive difference.

## Allergies
Roommates should disclose any allergies to make sure that everyone’s safe. Sometimes, it may be necessary to make special arrangements such as designated food storage areas or allergen-free zones (i.e. a separate toaster in case someone has a gluten allergy).
