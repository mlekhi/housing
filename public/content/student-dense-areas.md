# Student-Dense Areas
## Overview of Housing

When it comes to off-campus housing in London, ON, there are five main areas that students opt to live in: Masonville, Old North, Downtown, Oxford/Wharncliffe (South Side), Sarnia/Wonderland (West Side).

We will discuss each of these locations based on the below 4 important criteria 
- **Proximity to Campus** (determined by distance to the University Community Centre)
- **Access to Amenities and Essential Services**
- **Types of Housing and Major Properties**
- **The Social Aspect**

## Masonville 
### Proximity to Campus
As you might imagine, the region of Masonville is loosely centered around Masonville Mall. It is located directly north of campus, and students enjoy various bus options that help them get to class. In terms of getting to class, while some students are happy to talk 35+ minutes, the preferable alternative is taking one of the three available busses:

93: arrives every 25 minutes
13: arrives every 15 minutes
34: arrives every 35 minutes

### Access to Amenities and Essential Services
This region has tons of amenities very closeby, including but not limited to:
- GoodLife Fitnesss
- Grocery Stores: Bulk Barn, Food Boy, Loblaws, etc.
- Public Library, especially helpful when campus libraries are busy during exam seasons
- Shopping Centre: Masonville Mall
 
### Types of Housing and Major Properties
This region has a good mix of both townhomes and apartment-style properties, some key ‘landmarks’ can be found below:

- **Masonville Yards** is a rather pricey apartment building right in front of the mall. It has amenities like an ensuite washing machine, is fully furnished, and has tons of natural light. They also provide a shuttle to class, which reduces any commute troubles
- **Masonville Gardens** are a set of condominiums known for large living rooms, its good location, and responsive management. However, the buildings are a little dated, and some basement units lack natural light
- **Redbricks** on 1580 Richmond Street
- **Windermere Place** is a set of 3 apartment buildings, typically for graduate students that is well-kept and has seen very little issues historically
- **Masonville 42s** are a set of townhomes that are a little out of the way. They can get pricey, but they’re an enjoyable and rather large space.

### The Social Aspect
Given the very apartment-style living of this region, it is not the most social area ie not many pre games, clubs, or houseparties in this region. The typical social activity is going to the mall.
 
## Old North
### Proximity to Campus
The region of Old North is roughly between Masonville and Downtown, east/northeast of the main campus. One of the greatest advantages of this location is its close proximity to campus. While some bus routes are available, many students opt to walk, often taking the bridge on University Drive across the Thames River. A commonly referenced landmark in this area is the "University Main Gates" at University and Richmond, which helps define the region.

However, while areas such as Adelaide and Oxford can still be considered part of Old North, commuting from these locations to campus can be more challenging, often requiring multiple bus transfers or a longer walk. Students typically take bus 106 or bus 27 to get to the University Community Centre (UCC).

### Access to Amenities and Essential Services
A key downside of this region is that, due to its highly residential nature, amenities are not as readily available as in other student-heavy areas. If you have a car, access to essential services becomes significantly easier. Otherwise, the closest grocery stores are located on Adelaide, including Metro, FreshCo, and United Supermarket. Downtown is another option for a wider range of stores and services.

Developers in this area assume that given its proximity to campus, students will use campus facilities instead of requiring local amenities. Dining options are also somewhat limited, with few restaurants in the immediate vicinity apart from King Richie’s and a few smaller establishments. However, being close to Richmond Row means there are still plenty of food and entertainment options within reach.

For those who enjoy nature, the area is near Gibbons Park, Ross Park, and the Thames Valley Trail, all of which are great options for outdoor activities during daylight hours.

### Types of Housing and Major Properties

Old North primarily consists of detached, single-family homes. As a result, renting in this area can be somewhat fragmented, with fewer institutional landlords compared to areas like Oxford/Wharncliffe.

Some notable properties include:
- Redbricks on Huron Street: One of the few student apartment-style buildings in the area.
- The Luxe: A premium apartment complex located at the very north end of Old North, offering a more upscale living experience.

Unlike other student-heavy areas, some homes in Old North are still occupied by families, making it a unique mix of student and non-student residents.

### The Social Aspect
Old North is known for its vibrant social scene, which is a major draw for students. Given the prevalence of single-family homes, this area is popular for hosting gatherings and pre-games. Many students frequent this area for events such as St. Patrick’s Day and Homecoming, when Broughdale Ave becomes the center of student parties.
Additionally, its proximity to Richmond Street makes it an attractive choice for students looking to experience London’s nightlife. With just a short bus ride, residents can easily access the bars and clubs on Richmond Row. A recent addition to the social scene is Twins, a cafe by day and bar by night, which offers a more Toronto-inspired vibe. 
Overall, Old North is a great choice for students looking for a more social and lively living experience, balanced with close proximity to campus.

## Downtown London

As The Gazette details, downtown London showcases both the best and worst aspects of the city and student life. While it offers vibrant entertainment and amenities, it also has higher rates of crime and homelessness, making certain areas feel unsafe, especially at night.

### Proximity to Campus
The commute from downtown to campus takes approximately 20 minutes by bus, meaning students often have to wake up earlier and return home later than those living closer to campus. The most common bus routes to campus are the 102, 2, and 106.

### Access to Amenities and Essential Services
Downtown is packed with amenities, offering everything you could need within walking distance. Restaurants are abundant, ranging from casual spots like Chuck’s and Los Lobos to more upscale dining experiences such as La Cucina.

However, grocery stores in the area are limited, with Valu-Mart being the only major option—and it tends to be on the pricier side. That said, Western’s USC-run grocery shuttles provide students with transportation to larger grocery stores outside the downtown core. Additionally, living near Richmond or Oxford gives you access to more grocery options just a short bus ride away.
Having a car makes living downtown significantly more convenient, as it provides easier access to essential services and grocery stores beyond the immediate area.

### Types of Housing and Major Properties
Living downtown is heavily apartment-focused, and these units are typically smaller, meaning fewer roommates compared to housing options in other areas. While deals can be found, most downtown apartments are on the pricier side, often requiring four-figure monthly rent payments. That said, the prime location and walkability make it worth the cost for many students.
Some well-known apartment buildings include:

- 1 Richmond Row
- 675 Richmond Street
- 195 Dundas
- Aqui on King
- 520 Talbot
- Kingswell Towers
- 180 Mill Street
- The Harriston

### The Social Aspect

One of downtown’s biggest draws is its prime access to Richmond Row, London’s nightlife hub. Whether you’re heading to Delilah’s, Ceeps, or another bar or club, living downtown means you’re just steps away from the city’s best social scene. This makes it an attractive option for students who prioritize nightlife and entertainment.

Overall, downtown is a great choice for students who enjoy city living, don’t mind a slightly longer commute to campus, and want to be at the heart of London’s social and entertainment scene.

## Oxford/Wharncliffe (South Side)

Despite the prime location of this neighborhood, beware of the high rates of break-ins, especially over periods where school is out such as reading weeks or winter break. Be sure to lock doors, put up curtains, and reinforce windows with rods. While a student-heavy area, it may be sketchy at times.

### Proximity to Campus
Oxford and Wharncliffe is a hub for students, located about 20 minutes south of campus. Getting to campus is relatively easy, with a 20-minute walk to the south side of campus (Rec Centre, Ivey, residence) or a 4-5 minute bus ride. The 102, 2, 106, 93, and 94 all run frequently and provide quick access to campus.

### Access to Amenities and Essential Services
This area is home to the famous O/W McDonald’s and a variety of food options, including Burger Factory, Mustangs Dessert, Hakka Momo House, Pronto’s Pizza, and more.

Grocery stores in this area are somewhat lacking unless you have a car, with the closest being Valu-Mart and Costco, both over 20 minutes away. That said, the area has plenty of nature with Gibbons Park and Waldorf Park nearby. Other amenities, like banks, are available, but hospitals and other services are mostly found on campus.

### Types of Housing and Major Properties

This area features a mix of townhomes and apartments, with key properties including:
- The MARQ 1 Beaufort – Townhomes; decent location but watch out for long leases.
- The MARQ 205 Oxford & 75 Ann – Apartment buildings bridging downtown and Oxford.
- 939 Western Road & Western Pines – Townhomes for around four roommates.
- The Redbricks – A dominant player in this area, offering over 15 properties housing 1,000+ students. High demand, so apply early.

### The Social Aspect
Again, with the primarily apartment nature of this area, you won’t find many student-hosted pre-games in the area (though you might find the occasional Halloween or St. Patrick’s Day party on Ann Street). But, there is the Cowboys Ranch, just down the road, always a good time.

## Sarnia/Wonderland (West Side)
### Proximity to Campus

Sarnia and Wonderland is a well-equipped location when it comes to amenities, though not as convenient for commuting to campus.
Students have multiple bus options:
- 27, 10, or 33 provide direct routes to campus.
- 91/17 to Oxford/Wharncliffe with a connecting bus can also work.

Commute times range from 20–40 minutes, so planning ahead is key when deciding when to head home or travel to campus.

### Access to Amenities and Essential Services

This area is packed with amenities, making daily life convenient. Key highlights include:

- Restaurants: A diverse selection of authentic Chinese, Middle Eastern, and Italian cuisine.
- Bubble Tea: Popular spots like Coco’s.
- Groceries: Costco, Sobeys, Farm Boy, and T&T.
- Liquor Store: An LCBO in the plaza.
- Other Essentials: Banks, Value Village, car dealerships, a CrossFit gym, and even a dentist—helpful given the difficulty of booking on-campus appointments.

For those who love food and convenience, this area has everything you need.

### Types of Housing and Major Properties

Housing in this area is a mix of single-family homes and apartment buildings, including:

- 560/565 Proudfoot Lane
- The Trillium
- Capulet Towers
- Beaverbrook Towers
- Wonderland Place II
- Highview Residences
- The W

Given its popularity, housing in this area goes quickly, start looking early if you're interested.

### The Social Aspect

This is a quiet neighborhood, making it ideal for students who prefer a calm environment for studying. House parties are rare, and the area is not particularly close to bars or clubs. If you enjoy a more relaxed, sit-down social scene, this could be the perfect fit.
